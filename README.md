# 2D-Perlin-Noise

2D Perlin noise generator created for a 2D tile game I'm making. Customization for different frequencies and different amount of octaves.
Support for creating interpolated noise and white noise also included. However, it is no very optimised as of right now.

###Possible improvements
 - Improve random value algorithm.
   - Save pre-calculated values in a lookup table for subsequent calls with same arguments.
   - Improve seed calculation.
 - Add support for 1D noise.
 - Add support for linear and cosine interpolation.

I hope I was of some help!
